what does it do? (aka what do I need to figure out how to implement?)

- User accounts (using postgres & sqlalchemy)
- CRUD operations for books (add new books, view books, change book information, delete books)
- is it a "global" book database and then you can add them to your shelf individually? I think so.
- View books of different shelves (view books not on any of your shelves, but that are in the database)
- Change book information (prob just gonna have title, author, cover art?), put book on various shelves
- delete book (delete from database?? def delete from user shelves)
